                            <strong>adopting a cute and sweet puppy age plays a key role,</strong> the younger the
                            puppy, the less
                            likely it has been abused.

                            This means that you can provide him with a warm and supportive environment so that he grows
                            up to be a healthy and happy dog without the sediments of the past.

                            On the other hand, this means that you will have to educate and tame the puppy and survive
                            the puppyhood period with him, which is accompanied by the chewing of everything that comes
                            in and the considerable destruction of objects and furniture.

                            It is important to know that potty training a puppy is a process that requires commitment
                            and time, if you do not have enough time to potty train the puppy properly, it is
                            recommended to consider adopting a puppy that is potty trained (usually over six months
                            old).

                            being abandoned by their owners.

                            When you adopt an adult dog over two years old, you have to understand that many times the
                            dogs went through a difficult path before they came to you.

                            Some dogs have been abused, and some have been neglected, so they may suffer from a variety
                            of problems such as anxiety or aggressive behavior.

                            That is why it is important to treat them with patience and love, their psyche will often be
                            in a fragile state and it will take time for them to regain their confidence and trust.

                            With the right attitude and the appropriate knowledge in education and training, in a short
                            time, these dogs will enter your heart and become an integral part of the family.

                            There are dog breeds in which behavioral differences can be observed between males and
                            females. In Pomeranian dogs, for example, males bark more than females usually.

                            If the decision is between a neutered adult dog versus a spayed adult female dog, the
                            decision is less significant because neutering or neutering usually calms the dog or female
                            down, making them less aggressive towards their own kind and more relaxed in the home.

                              When deciding on the size of the dog, many people tend to think that small dogs are calmer and therefore they choose a small dog, but many times there is no connection between the size of the dog and its behavior and therefore the decision regarding the size of the dog should be influenced by the size of the apartment (a large dog can be a bit cramped in a 2-room apartment ) and the place where the dog will sleep (smaller dogs are sensitive to the cold and are not suitable for sleeping in the yard or garden).
